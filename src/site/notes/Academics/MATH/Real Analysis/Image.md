Let $X$ and $Y$ be sets and let $f:X\to Y$ be a function. Let $S\subseteq X$, then the set $f(S)=\{ f(x)\in Y: x\in S \}$ is called the image/forward image of the set $S$ under the function $f$



# Examples
$f(x)=x^{2}$
$S=[1,3]$
$f(S)=\{ f(x):x \in [1,3] \}= [1,9]$

$S=(-2,1)$, $f(S)=[0,4)$
(the fact the input set is open or closed doesn't dictate the resulting output set)

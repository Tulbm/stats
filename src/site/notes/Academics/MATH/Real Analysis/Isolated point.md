Let $(X,d)$ be a metric space. An **isolated point** is a point $a\in X$ such that exists $r\in \mathbb{R}^{+}$ such that $B_{r}(a)$ contains no other points than $a$ itself ($B_{r}(a)=\{ a \}$)
- every point of $\mathbb{N}$ is an isolated point
- A set $S$ in which all $x\in S$ are isolated points is called a **discrete set**

Suppose that, given an indexing set $\Lambda$, we have that $\{ U_{\lambda} \}_{\lambda\in \Lambda}$ provides an [[Open Cover]] for a subset $S$ of $X$. 

A selection of some of the sets in this cover is called a subcollection of sets. If that subcollection still provides an open cover for $S$, we call that subcollection a subcover for $S$.

A finite subcover has finite many elements (sets)

# Examples

For any $U_{n}= (- \frac{1}{n}, \frac{1}{n})$, the set provides

 

Let $S=[0,1]\subset \mathbb{R}$ and consider the open intervals $U_{\lambda}=\left( - \frac{1}{4}+ \lambda, \frac{3}{4}+ \lambda \right)$ for $\lambda \in [0, \frac{1}{2}], \lambda \in \mathbb{R}$. Then $\{ U_{n} \}$ provides an open cover for $S$

And $\{ U_{0},U_{0.5} \}$ provides a subcover for $S$. This subcover is made of just two open sets, thus is actually provides a finite subcover for $S$
